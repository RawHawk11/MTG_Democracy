                        <p>
                        Hello and welcome to the Captain format of Magic: The Gathering! So what is The Captain Format?
			</p> 
			    
			<p>
			The Captain Format strives to be a democratically-managed Magic: the Gathering format where players themselves submit proposals to change the format and then vote on those changes.
			</p> 
			    
			<p>
			There we have volunteers who’ve joined committees to help manage and develop the format in its infancy, until such time as the format is turned over to the public at large. If you would like to participate, join the discord server and ask in a committee channel.
  			</p> 
			
			<img src="img/Roles.jpg" alt="Image" class="img-fluid">
			
			<ul>
			1) The Information Technology Committee (IT) focuses on the website, creating a secure voting system, IT security, accounts administration, and ensuring all documents created by ConCom and Elected Administrators are readily available in one spot online. 
			</ul>
      <ul>
			2) The Social Media Committee (SM) manages our social media platforms. They share statements, community events, and Magic news.
			</ul>
      <ul>
      3) Elected Administrators (EA) sole duty is to actively listen to what the community is talking about, what they might wish to see happen to the format and help to guide and foster community ideas.
			</ul>
      <ul>
			4) Scribes and Clerks. They record all the meetings, record all ideas for the constitution, note outcomes, votes, desires, disagreements, and keep tabs on the voice call discussions so nothing gets left behind and it’s all documented. 
			</ul>
      <ul>
      5) Moderators (Mods) are responsible for enforcing the constitution and preventing trolls from excluding groups or indivduals who have a right to be equals. Mods in addition solve disputes between people and enact equality for all.
     	</ul>
      <ul>
      5.5) Lead Mods in Discord are responsible for controlling of the Mods specifically in Discord. Lead Mods resolve esculated issues brought forward from the Mod team.
			</ul>
      <ul>
			6) The Constitution Committee (ConCom) are a temporary group who are primary contributors and record keepers during the creation and finalization of the Constitution.
			</ul>
			    
			<p>	
			When the website is running and the Constitution is passed, control of The Captain Format will pass from the committees to the players at large.
      </p>

      <h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">The History</h2>
      <p>
      When Captain was first realized, it was created on an unmoderated discord server that was overrun with bigots and was quickly shut down. When we left and created a new server, some of those bigots and bad actors followed.
			</p>
			<p>
			We’ve since banned many of these bad actors, but they defined the early reputation of Captain, and reputations are hard to shake. The best way to change it is for Captain to be an open community that’s welcoming to Magic players who are welcoming to others.
			</p>
			<p>
			We listen to criticisms of Captain and of The Captain Format --certainly, we have enough of them among ourselves-- and we encourage you to listen to those criticisms as well and offer your own, but we hope you give the format a chance, hang around, and play some Captain with us.
      </p>

			<h2 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">The Future</h2>
      <p>
      As all organizations require consistency in how rules are kept and maintained, Captain members will vote for Elected Administrators who serve limited terms. The Elected Administrators main job is to facilitate players playing Captain. They do this by maintaining The Captain Format’s administrative needs, focusing community initiatives, creating poll outlines, keeping records, and filtering bad faith suggestions out of the community. 
			</p>
			<p>
			All the power of the format lies in the community's hands via voting. Members of the community will submit issues, decide on whether those issues need to move forward, and then have a final vote on solutions to those issues. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Captain isn’t drastically different from Commander right now. People say we need to distinguish ourselves from Commander. In time we may, but we believe that our foundation of democratic inclusion and reliance on the Magic: the Gathering community will make a positive contribution to Magic, and that’s how we distinguish ourselves.
      </p>
