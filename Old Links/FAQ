						<p>
						
						 <Strong>Q.</Strong> I am a magic player who wants to join Captain. <BR>
						 What are is the cost to join? <BR>
						 
						 <Strong>A.</Strong> Free to join. All we ask is you follow the rules. 
						 <BR> <BR>
						 
						 
						 
						 <Strong>Q.</Strong> Cool, so where do I find these rules?
						 <BR>
						 
						 <Strong>A.</Strong> Great question! You can find the Community Constitution <Strong><u><a href="https://mtgcaptain.cards/Constitution.html">HERE</a></Strong></u><BR>
						 The End User License Agreement (EULA) <Strong><u><a href="https://mtgcaptain.cards/EULA.html">HERE</a></Strong></u><BR>
						 The Privacy Policy <Strong><u><a href="https://mtgcaptain.cards/PrivacyPolicy">HERE</a></Strong></u>
						 <BR> <BR>
						 
						 
						 
						 <Strong>Q.</Strong> Thanks! That's swell of ya but wowie that sure is a lot to read. <BR>
						 Is there a more condensed version I could read?
						 <BR>
						 
						 <Strong>A.</Strong> Yeah that is a lot of text. Check out Captain TLDR <Strong><u><a href="https://mtgcaptain.cards/Captain-TLDR">HERE</a></Strong></u><BR>
						 <BR> <BR>
						 
						 
						 
						 <Strong>Q.</Strong> Neat. First thing I should do is join a Social Media platform, then I can play some games. <BR>
						 What if I need help if I get stuck on the Social Media platform?
						 <BR>
						 
						 <Strong>A.</Strong> Chat with a Social Media Moderator. <BR>
						 These are the people who enforce the Community Constitution but also are there to assist with their own Social Media and it's channels or tabs. <BR>
						 Moderators cannot assist with technical issues or bugs, but can help with rules enforcement, rules questions, and how to find a Social Media function in the community.
						 <BR> <BR>
						 
						 
						 
						 <Strong>Q.</Strong> Okay that is good. How about if I have a technical issue, need access to something technical on the website or Social Media platform, <BR>
						 or have an idea / improvement I want to see done on the website or Social Media platform. <BR>
						 Who do I talk to?
						 <BR>
						 
						 <Strong>A.</Strong> Feel free to ask one of the IT members. <BR>
						 If none are available talk to a Mod as the Mods all have direct connections to IT so that an IT member can find and talk to you. <BR>
						 IT cannot assist with user moderation or rules enforcement, but can help with bots, platform functions, and many other tasks.
						 <BR> <BR>
						 
						 
						 
						 <Strong>Q.</Strong> Super! So how about if I have a card I want banned, unbanned, or a rule changed. <BR>
						 How do I make my change happen?
						 <BR>
						 
						 <Strong>A.</Strong> We want to see your suggestion. Send it over to the Community Proposals page found <Strong><u><a href="https://mtgcaptain.cards/CommunityProposals.html">HERE</a></Strong></u> <BR>
						 Be sure to include as many details as possible. The more details about a specific concern the better the odds it will be passed into the format. <BR>
						 Don't forget to include your Discord username or some kind of user handle so you have a chance to update it later and if we need to contact you back to make it viable for a vote. <BR>
						 If you don't sign it you run the very real risk of having the proposal denied.
						 <BR> <BR>
						 
						 
						 
						 <Strong>Q.</Strong> That sounds simple. Details details details, or else lack of results. <BR>
						 Where do I find the proposals submitted so far?
						 <BR>
						 
						 <Strong>A.</Strong> All proposals past, present, and future will be found <Strong><u><a href="https://mtgcaptain.cards/Archived-Proposals">HERE</a></Strong></u>
						 <BR> <BR>
						 
						 
						 
						 <Strong>Q.</Strong> Okay. So who is in charge of the format? Who is the manager or boss?
						 <BR>
						 
						 <Strong>A.</Strong> No one is. <BR>
						 Each department is responsible to complete tasks, but there is no such thing as a manager or boss or ruler of any kind. <BR>
						 This is a democratic format meaning there is zero hierarchy, only responsibilities which differ in different departments. <BR>
						 <BR>
						 - Elected Administrators filter proposals, push vote requirements to IT to setup <BR>
						 - Scribe tracks and moderates Elected Administrator events, and publish vote results on an as needed basis <BR>
						 - Social Media (Moderators) enforce the Community Constitution on Social Media platforms, as well as moderate bad faith members on their own platforms <BR>
						 - IT handles technology maintenance, host technical infrastructures, change management, and follows requests of other departments while maintaining integrity of platform security <BR>
						 <BR> <BR>
						 
						 
						 
						 <Strong>Q.</Strong> That sounds  really good. <BR>
						 Is there anything else I need to know?
						 <BR>
						 
						 <Strong>A.</Strong> At this time I do not think so, you asked a lot of good questions we hope we were able to help with. <BR>
						 If you do have any new questions you need answering and what to see those posted here please contact the IT department. <BR>
						 <BR>
						 Thank you, <BR>
						 - The Captain's Crew
