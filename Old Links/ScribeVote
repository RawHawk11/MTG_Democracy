						Starting immediately we will be having a snap election for the MTG Captain Scribe position. <BR>  <BR>
						
						Our prior Scribe for 2020, HobbitWhoCould#4068, had to step down for personal reasons and can no longer maintain the Scribe position. <BR>   <BR>
						
						Hobbit's depature message: <BR>  <BR>
						
						<em> It has been a truly fascinating and enjoyable experience to be a part of this since day 1. Seeing everyone self organize, put the needs of others ahead of themselves, make the right and healthy decisions, and follow a superb democratic process has brought me immeasurable joy. Being a part of that has brought me immeasurable joy. Meeting so many of you beautiful souls, who I hope I can call lifelong friends, has brought me immeasurable joy.  <BR>  <BR>

						Unfortunately, today my heart is nothing but heavy, as I must resign from my position of Scribe due to health issues. I am worried this will prevent me from dependably handling the responsibilities.  <BR>  <BR>

						My dedication to seeing this being a successful format will continue, however. I will work with the powers that be to ensure an easy transition. I will prepare all my assets to be transferred to the next elected Scribe, and will ensure they have the resources and understanding of the Constitution, Roberts Rules, and anything else needed for the position. Minus having another vote (which I am gravely sorry for), you shouldn't even notice anything is going on! Furthermore, I will still be reachable. My DMs and Private Server are always open. I will continue to give advisement on Constitutional issues as needed, and will strive to be available to write any updates & amendments to should it be needed.  <BR> <BR>

						Sláinte, <BR>
						HobbitWhoCould </em>  <BR> <BR>

					<h6 class="pt-3 tm-mb-20 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">TeaLeaf-Senpai#9519</h6>
					<p>
					I'll start with a short introduction of myself. Hi, I'm Tea Leaf, and I've been playing MTG for ~15 ish years now. I started playing EDH about ~7 ish years ago and loved it until the whole debacle with SLD-TWD. Since then, I've divorced myself from the commander RC because they don't listen to input and aren't very good at judging the fanbase. Even the CAG seems too far removed to be actually useful in representing the general interests of the community. Hence my joining captain when Mitch jokingly proposed it though it became much more after a community got organized around it. <BR> <BR> 

					Those of you that have been here since the beginning may remember me from the Constitutional Committee, where I was the primary scribe that ran the meetings with Hobbit. In fact, if you look at the meeting notes for ConCom, you will see my name as the scribe for most of the meeting minutes. Additionally, I have in depth knowledge of both Roberts Rules and Parliamentary Procedure for the purposes of keeping order in meetings from my many executive board experiences in college. Off the top of my head, I was on the E-board for my college's debate club, badminton club, pokemon club, music/orchestral club, resident student association, and also the student senate/government at one point or another. I also had a hand in founding a few of those so I have extensive experience in this area. <BR> <BR>
					
					I'm also anticipating this being an issue in advance so I'll address it now. Those of you that have been around for a bit have probably noticed my absence for the last few months. That has more to do with my irl personal issuesand I had to step away to deal with several irl emergencies. To start with, I got sick with something that was almost covid but not quite and was pretty nauseously ill for a few weeks. That then turned into drama and problems with and at work after I recovered. In the middle of that mess, I also ended up moving from NY to AZ (time zone changes suck, esp when you're still getting over an illness and vomiting every other day). So understandably, I stepped away to deal with all of that (among other minor personal issues). But all of that is squared away and dealt with so now that i have the time and mental capacity to be more active again, I have decided to do so. <BR> <BR> 

					As the co-scribe for ConCom, with Hobbit being the other, it was suggested to me that I place my name up for candidacy for the EA council scribe position as I am already familiar with most of its requirements in terms of note-taking at meetings, keeping order via RR and ParliPro, and the other miscellaneous duties involved in parsing community proposals and updating the constitution considering that I penned most of the notes for why things ended up the way they have. So I did that and here I am. If you have any questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to @ me or DM me and Ill get to it when I can. 
					</p> <BR>
