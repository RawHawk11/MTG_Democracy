                            <ol>
                                <li>Players choose a legendary creature as the Captain for their deck. </li>
                                <li>A card’s colour identity is its color plus the colour of any mana symbols in the card’s rules text. A card’s color identity is established before the game begins, and cannot be changed by game effects. The cards in a deck may not have any colours in their color identity which are not in the colour identity of the deck’s Captain.</li>
                                <li>A Captain deck must contain exactly 100 cards, including the Captain. If you’re playing a companion, it must adhere to color identity and singleton rules. While it is not part of the deck, it is effectively a 101st card.</li>
                                <li>With the exception of basic lands, no two cards in the deck may have the same English name. Some cards (e.g. Relentless Rats) may have rules text that overrides this restriction.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <h3 class="pt-2 tm-mb-40 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Play Rules</h3>
                                <ol start='5'>
                                <li>Players begin the game with 40 life.</li>
                                <li>Captains begin the game in the Command Zone. 
                                    While a Captain is in the command zone, it may be cast, subject to the normal timing restrictions for casting creatures. 
                                    Its owner must pay  for each time it was previously cast from the command zone; this is an additional cost.</li>
                                <li>Each Captain begins the game in the Command Zone. While a Captain is in the command zone, it may be cast, subject to the normal timing restrictions for casting creatures. Its owner must pay ( 2 ) for each time it was previously cast from the command zone; this is an additional cost.</li>
                                <li>If a Captain is in a graveyard or in exile and that card was put into that zone since the last time state-based actions were checked, its owner may put it into the command zone. If a Captain would be put into its owner’s hand or library from anywhere, its owner may put it into the command zone instead. This replacement effect may apply more than once to the same event.</li>
				<li>Being a Captain is not a characteristic [MTG CR109.3], it is a property of the card and tied directly to the physical card. As such, “Captain-ness” cannot be copied or overwritten by continuous effects. The card retains it’s Captain-ness through any status changes, and is still a Captain even when controlled by another player.</li>
                                <li>If a player has been dealt 21 points of combat damage by a particular captain during the game, that player loses a game.</li>
                                <li>Captains are subject to the Legend rule; a player cannot control more than one legend with the same name.</li>
                                <li>Abilities which bring other card(s) you own from outside the game into the game 
                                    (such as Living Wish; Spawnsire of Ulamog; Karn, the Great Creator) do not function in Captain.</li>

	    		    </p>
			    
			    <p>
			    903.13a	-	Captain is a community driven format. Captain games use the normal rules for the Commander variant with the following modifications.
	    		    </p>
			    
			    <p>
			    903.13b	-	Captain is managed by its community, who maintain additional resources at http://MTGCaptain.Cards
	    		    </p>
			    
			    <p>
			    903.13c	-	Players of the Captain Format informally refer to their Commanders as “Captains”
	    		    </p>
			    
			    <p>
			    In the event of sufficient divergence from Commander, The Comprehensive Rules should be rewritten into 90X following the formatting of other casual variants.
